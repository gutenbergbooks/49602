<h2>THE LAME LOVER.</h2>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> Serjeant <span class="smallcaps">Circuit</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Charlot</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>
<p>I tell you, Sir, his love to me is all a
pretence: it is amazing that you,
who are so acute, so quick in discerning
on other occasions, should
be so blind upon this.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>But where are your proofs, Charlot? What
signifies your opening matters which your evidence
cannot support?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Surely, Sir, strong circumstances in every
court should have weight.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>So they have collaterally, child, that is by way
as it were of corroboration, or where matters are
doubtful; then indeed, as Plowden wisely observes
"Les circonstances ajout beaucoup depoids
aux faits."&mdash;You understand me?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Not perfectly well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Then to explain by case in point; A, we
will suppose, my dear, robs B of a watch upon
Hounslow heath&mdash;dy'e mind, child?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I do, Sir.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>A, is taken up and indicted; B swears positively
to the identity of A.&mdash;Dy'e observe?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Attentively.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Then what does me A, but sets up the alibi
C, to defeat the affidavit of B.&mdash;You take me.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Clearly.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>So far you see then the ballance is even.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>True.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>But then to turn the scale, child, against A, in
favour of B, they produce the circumstance D,
viz. B's watch found in the pocket of A; upon
which, the testimony of C being contradicted
by B,&mdash;no, by D,&mdash;why then A, that is to say C,&mdash;no
D,&mdash;joining B, they convict C,&mdash;no, no,
A,&mdash;against the affidavit of C.&mdash;So this being
pretty clear, child, I leave the application to you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Very obliging, Sir. But suppose now, Sir, it
should appear that the attention of Sir Luke
Limp is directed to some other object, would
not that induce you to&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Other object! Where?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>In this very house.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Here! why the girl is non compos; there's
nobody here, child, but a parcel of Abigals.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>No, Sir?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>No.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Yes, Sir, one person else.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Who is that?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>But remember, Sir, my accusation is confined
to Sir Luke.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well, well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Suppose then, Sir, those powerful charms
which made a conquest of you, may have extended
their empire over the heart of Sir Luke?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why, hussy, you don't hint at your mother-in-law?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, Sir, but I do.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay; why this is point blank treason against
my sovereign authority: but can you, Charlot,
bring proof of any overt acts?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Overt acts!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay; that is any declaration by writing, or
even word of mouth is sufficient; then let 'em
demur if they dare.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I can't say that, Sir; but another organ has
been pretty explicit.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Which?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>In those cases a very infallible one&mdash;the eye.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Pshaw! nonsense and stuff.&mdash;The eye!&mdash;The
eye has no authority in a court of law.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Perhaps not, Sir, but it is a decisive evidence
in a court of love.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Hark you, hussy, why you would not file an
information against the virtue of madam your
mother; you would not insinuate that she has
been guilty of crim. con.?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Sir, you mistake me; it is not the lady, but
the gentleman I am about to impeach.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Have a care, Charlot! I see on what ground
your action is founded&mdash;jealousy.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>You were never more deceiv'd in your life;
for it is impossible, my dear Sir, that jealousy can
subsist without love.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>And from that passion (thank heaven) I am
pretty free at present.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>A sweet object to excite tender desires!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>And why not, hussy?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>First as to his years.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What then?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I own, Sir, age procures honor, but I believe
it is very rarely productive of love.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Mighty well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>And tho' the loss of a leg can't be imputed to
Sir Luke Limp as a fault&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I hope, Sir, at least you will allow it a misfortune.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>A pretty thing truly, for a girl, at my time of
life, to be ty'd to a man with one foot in the
grave.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>One foot in the grave! the rest of his body is
not a whit the nearer for that.&mdash;There has been
only an execution issued against part of his personals,
his real estate is unencumbered and free&mdash;besides,
you see he does not mind it a whit,
but is as alert, and as merry, as a defendant after
non-suiting a plaintiff for omitting an S.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>O! Sir! I know how proud Sir Luke is of his
leg, and have often heard him declare, that he
would not change his bit of timber for the best
flesh and bone in the kingdom.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>There's a hero for you!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>To be sure, sustaining unavoidable evils
with constancy is a certain sign of greatness of
mind.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Doubtless.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>But then to derive a vanity from a misfortune,
will not I'm afraid be admitted as a vast instance
of wisdom, and indeed looks as if the man had
nothing better to distinguish himself by.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How does that follow?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>By inunendo.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Negatur.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Besides, Sir, I have other proofs of your hero's
vanity, not inferior to that I have mention'd.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Cite them.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>The paltry ambition of levying and following
titles.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Titles! I don't understand you?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I mean the poverty of fastening in public upon
men of distinction, for no other reason but
because of their rank; adhering to Sir John till
the Baronet is superceded by my Lord; quitting
the puny Peer for an Earl; and sacrificing all
three to a Duke.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Keeping good company! a laudable ambition!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>True, Sir, if the virtues that procur'd the
father a peerage, could with that be entail'd on
the son.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Have a care, hussy&mdash;there are severe laws
against speaking evil of dignities.&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Sir!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Scandalum magnatum is a statute must not be
trifled with: why you are not one of those vulgar
sluts that think a man the worse for being a Lord?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>No, Sir; I am contented with only, not thinking
him the better.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>For all this, I believe, hussy, a right honourable
proposal would soon make you alter your
mind.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Not unless the proposer had other qualities
than what he possesses by patent. Besides, Sir,
you know Sir Luke is a devotee to the bottle.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Not a whit the less honest for that.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>It occasions one evil at least; that when
under its influence, he generally reveals all,
sometimes more than he knows.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Proofs of an open temper, you baggage: but,
come, come, all these are but trifling objections.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>You mean, Sir, they prove the object a trifle.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why you pert jade; do you play on my words?
I say Sir Luke is&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Nobody.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Nobody! how the deuce do you make that
out?&mdash;He is neither person attained or outlaw'd,
may in any of his majesty's courts sue
or be sued, appear by attorney, or in propria
persona, can acquire, buy, procure, purchase,
possess, and inherit, not only personalities, such
as goods, and chattels, but even realities, as
all lands, tenements, and hereditaments, whatsoever,
and wheresoever.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>But, Sir&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Nay, further child, he may sell, give, bestow,
bequeath, devise, demise, lease, or to
farm lett, ditto lands, to any person whomsoever&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Without doubt, Sir; but there are notwithstanding
in this town a great number of nobodies,
not described by lord Coke.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Hey!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>There is your next-door neighbour, Sir Harry
Hen, an absolute blank.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How so, Mrs. Pert?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>What, Sir! a man who is not suffer'd to hear,
see, smell, or in short to enjoy the free use of any
one of his senses; who, instead of having a positive
will of his own, is deny'd even a paltry negative;
who can neither resolve or reply, consent
or deny, without first obtaining the leave of his
lady: an absolute monarch to sink into the
sneaking state of being a slave to one of his subjects&mdash;Oh
fye!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why, to be sure, Sir Harry Hen, is as I may
say&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Nobody Sir, in the fullest sense of the word&mdash;Then
your client Lord Solo.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Heyday!&mdash;Why you would not annihilate a
peer of the realm, with a prodigious estate and
an allow'd judge too of the elegant arts.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>O yes, Sir, I am no stranger to that nobleman's
attributes; but then, Sir, please to consider,
his power as a peer he gives up to a proxy;
the direction of his estate, to a rapacious, artful
attorney: and as to his skill in the elegant arts,
I presume you confine them to painting and
music, he is directed in the first by Mynheer
Van Eisel, a Dutch dauber; and in the last is
but the echo of Signora Florenza, his lordship's
mistress and an opera singer.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Mercy upon us! at what a rate the jade runs!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>In short, Sir, I define every individual who,
ceasing to act for himself, becomes the tool, the
mere engine of another man's will, to be nothing
more than a cypher.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>At this rate the jade will half unpeople the
world: but what is all this to Sir Luke? to
him, not one of your cases apply.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Every one&mdash;Sir Luke has not a first principle
in his whole composition; not only his pleasures,
but even his passions are prompted by
others; and he is as much directed to the objects
of his love and his hatred, as in his eating,
drinking, and dressing. Nay, though he is
active, and eternally busy, yet his own private
affairs are neglected; and he would not scruple
to break an appointment that was to determine
a considerable part of his property, in order to
exchange a couple of hounds for a lord, or to
buy a pad-nag for a lady. In a word&mdash;but he's
at hand, and will explain himself best; I hear
his stump on the stairs.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I hope you will preserve a little decency before
your lover at least.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Lover! ha, ha, ha!</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><br />
<i>Enter Sir</i> <span class="smallcaps">Luke Limp</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Serjeant, your slave&mdash;Ah! are you there
my little&mdash;O Lord! Miss, let me tell you
something for fear of forgetting&mdash;Do you know
that you are new christen'd, and have had me
for a gossip?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Christen'd! I don't understand you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Then lend me your ear&mdash;Why last night, as
Colonel Kill'em, Sir William Weezy, Lord Frederick
Foretop, and I were carelessly sliding the
Ranelagh round, picking our teeth, after a
damn'd muzzy dinner at Boodle's, who should
trip by but an abbess, well known about town,
with a smart little nun in her suite. Says Weezy
(who, between ourselves, is as husky as hell)
Who is that? odds flesh, she's a delicate wench!
Zounds! cried Lord Frederick, where can
Weezy have been, not to have seen the Harietta
before? for you must know Frederick is a bit
of Macaroni, and adores the soft Italian termination
in <i>a</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>He does?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Yes, a delitanti all over.&mdash;Before? replied
Weezy; crush me if ever I saw any thing half
so handsome before!&mdash;No! replied I in an instant;
Colonel, what will Weezy say when he
sees the Charlotta?&mdash;Hey! you little<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Meaning me, I presume.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Without doubt; and you have been toasted
by that name ever since.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What a vast fund of spirits he has!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>And why not, my old splitter of causes?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I was just telling Charlot, that you was not a
whit the worse for the loss.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>The worse! much the better, my dear. Consider,
I can have neither strain, splint, spavin,
or gout; have no fear of corns, kibes, or that
another man should kick my shins, or tread on
my toes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Right.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>What d'ye think I would change with Bill
Spindle for one of his drumsticks, or chop with
Lord Lumber for both of his logs?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>No!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>No, damn it, I am much better.&mdash;Look
there&mdash;Ha!&mdash;What is there I am not able to
do? To be sure I am a little aukward at running;
but then, to make me amends, I'll hop
with any man in town for his sum.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay, and I'll go his halves.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Then as to your dancing, I am cut out at
Madam Cornelly's, I grant, because of the
croud; but as far as a private set of six couple,
or moving a chair-minuet, match me who can.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>A chair-minuet! I don't understand you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Why, child, all grace is confined to the motion
of the head, arms, and chest, which may
sitting be as fully displayed, as if one had as
many legs as a polypus.&mdash;As thus&mdash;tol de rol&mdash;don't
you see?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Very plain.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>A leg! a redundancy! a mere nothing at all.
Man is from nature an extravagant creature. In
my opinion, we might all be full as well as we
are, with but half the things that we have.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Ay, Sir Luke; how do you prove that?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>By constant experience.&mdash;You must have seen
the man who makes and uses pens without hands.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I have.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>And not a twelvemonth agone, I lost my way
in a fog, at Mile-End, and was conducted to
my house in May-Fair by a man as blind as a
beetle.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Wonderful!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>And as to hearing and speaking, those organs
are of no manner of use in the world.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>If you doubt it, I will introduce you to a
whole family, dumb as oysters, and deaf as the
dead, who chatter from morning till night by
only the help of their fingers.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why, Charlot, these are cases in point.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Oh! clear as a trout-stream; and it is not
only, my little Charlot, that this piece of timber
answers every purpose, but it has procured me
many a bit of fun in my time.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Why, it was but last summer, at Tunbridge,
we were plagued the whole season by a bullet-headed
Swiss from the canton of Bern, who was
always boasting, what, and how much he dared
do; and then, as to pain, no Stoic, not Diogenes,
held it more in contempt.&mdash;By gods, he
vas no more minds it dan notings at all&mdash;So,
foregad, I gave my German a challenge.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>As how!&mdash;Mind, Charlot.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Why to drive a corkin pin into the calves of
our legs.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well, well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Mine, you may imagine, was easily done&mdash;but
when it came to the Baron&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay, ay.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Our modern Cato soon lost his coolness and
courage, screw'd his nose up to his foretop,
rapp'd out a dozen oaths in high Dutch, limp'd
away to his lodgings, and was there laid up for
a month&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<div class="center">

<i>Enter a Servant, and delivers a Card to</i> Sir Luke.
</p>
</div>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">Sir LUKE <i>reads</i>.
</p>
</div>

<p>"Sir Gregory Goose desires the honour of
Sir Luke Limp's company to dine. An
answer is desired." Gadso! a little unlucky;
I have been engag'd for these three weeks.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What, I find Sir Gregory is return'd for the
corporation of <i>Fleesum</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Is he so? Oh ho!&mdash;That alters the case.&mdash;George,
give my compliments to Sir Gregory,
and I'll certainly come and dine there. Order
Joe to run to alderman Inkle's, in Threadneedle-street;
sorry can't wait upon him, but confin'd
to bed two days with <i>new influenza</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>You make light, Sir Luke, of these sort of
engagements.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>What can a man do? These damn'd fellows
(when one has the misfortune to meet
them) take scandalous advantage; teaze, When
will you do me the honour, pray, Sir Luke, to
take a bit of mutton with me? Do you name
the day&mdash;They are as bad as a beggar, who
attacks your coach at the mounting of a hill;
there is no getting rid of them, without a penny
to one, and a promise to t'other.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>True; and then for such a time too&mdash;three
weeks! I wonder they expect folks to remember.
It is like a retainer in Michaelmas term
for the summer assizes.</p>

England is more punctual than<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Earl of Brentford. The servant waits for an

<p>Immediately upon receiving the answer.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Run after him as fast as you can&mdash;tell him,
quite in despair&mdash;recollect an engagement that
can't in nature be missed,&mdash;and return in an instant.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>You see, Sir, the Knight must give way for
my Lord.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>No, faith, it is not that, my dear Charlot;
you saw that was quite an extempore business.&mdash;No,
hang it, no, it is not for the title; but
to tell you the truth, Brentford has more wit
than any man in the world; it is that makes
me fond of his house.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>By the choice of his company he gives an unanswerable
instance of that.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>You are right, my dear girl. But now to
give you a proof of his wit: You know Brentford's
finances are a little out of repair, which
procures him some visits that he would very
gladly excuse.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What need he fear? His person is sacred;
for by the tenth of William and Mary&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>He knows that well enough; but for all
that&mdash;</p>

<p>Seiz'd upon when they can find them, but
he lives in ready-furnish'd lodgings, and hires
his coach by the month.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Nay, if the sheriff return "non inventus"&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>A pox o' your law, you make me lose sight
of my story. One morning, a Welch coach-maker
came with his bill to my Lord, whose name
was unluckily Loyd. My Lord had the man
up. You are call'd, I think, Mr. Loyd?&mdash;At
your Lordship's service, my Lord.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>What,
Loyd with an L?&mdash;It was with an L indeed,
my Lord.&mdash;Because in your part of the
world I have heard that Loyd and Floyd were
synonymous, the very same names.&mdash;Very often
indeed, my lord.&mdash;But you always spell your's
with an L?&mdash;Always.&mdash;That, Mr. Loyd, is a
little unlucky; for you must know I am now
paying my debts alphabetically, and in four or
five years you might have come in with an F;
but I am afraid I can give you no hopes for
your L.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>Pardon, dear Serjeant and Charlotta; have a
thousand things to do for half a million of people
positively; promised to procure a husband
for Lady Cicely Sulky, and match a coach-horse
for Brigadier Whip; after that, must run into
the city to borrow a thousand for young At-all
at Almack's; send a Cheshire cheese by the
stage to Sir Timothy Tankard in Suffolk; and
get at the Herald's Office a coat of arms to

and preposterous!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why, by their public practice, my love, one
would suspect that they thought themselves excepted
by a particular clause.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Oh! to be sure; not the least doubt can be
made.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>True, chuck&mdash;But then your great friends
should never complain of highwaymen stopping
their coaches, or thieves breaking into their
houses.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Why, what has that to do with the business?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Oh! the natural consequence, lovee; for
whilst the superiors are throwing away their
fortunes, and consequently their independence
<i>above</i>&mdash;you can't think but their domestics are
following their examples <i>below</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Well, and what then?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Then! the same distress that throws the master
and mistress into the power of any who are
willing to purchase them, by a regular gradation,
reduces the servants to actions, though more
<i>criminal</i>, perhaps not more <i>atrocious</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Pshaw! stuff!&mdash;I have no head to examine
your dirty distinctions&mdash;Don't teize me with
your jargon.&mdash;I have told you the sums I shall
want, so take care they are ready at your returning
from Kingston.&mdash;Nay, don't hesitate; recollect
your own state of the case, and remember,
my honour is in pawn, and must, some way or
other, be redeem'd by the end of the week.</p>

</div>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Jack, let Will bring the chaise to the
door.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Fairplay, Sir, the attorney, begs to speak
a few words.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How often have I told you, that I will see
none of these sort of folks but at chambers;
you know how angry your mother is at their
rapping, and littering the house.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>He says, Sir, he will not detain you five minutes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well, bid him walk in.</p>

<div class="center">
<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Fairplay</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, Mr. Fairplay, what's your will?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>I just call'd, Mr. Serjeant, to know your opinion
upon the case of young Woodford, and if
you like the proposal of being concern'd.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>If it turns out as you state it, and that the father
of the lad was really a minor, the Essex
estate may without doubt be recover'd; and so
may the lands in the North.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>We have full proofs to that fact.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>May be so; but really Mr. Fairplay, you
know the length of time that these kind of
suits&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>True Sir, but then your experience will
shorten I appreh<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>That's more than I know: and then not only
my fees lying dormant, but, perhaps, an expectation
of money advanc'd.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>The property, Sir, is of very great value, and,
upon the recovery, any acknowledgment shall
be readily made.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>There again, <i>any</i>! do you know that in law,
that word <i>any</i> has no meaning at all? besides,
when people are in distress, they are lavish
enough of their offers; but when their business
is done, then we have nothing but grumbling
and grudging.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>You have only to dictate your terms.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Does the lad live in town?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>He has been under my care since the death
of his father; I have given him as good an education
as my narrow fortune would let me; he
is now studying the law in the Temple, in hopes
that should he fail of other assistance, he may
be able one day to do <i>himself</i> justice.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>In the Temple?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>Yes, Sir, in those little chambers just over
your head&mdash;I fancy the young gentleman knows
him.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Who? Mr. Woodford! Lord as well as myself,
he is a sweet sober youth, and will one day
make a vast figure, I am sure.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>I am positive, Sir, if you were to hear him
speak at the Robinhood in the Butcher-row, you
would say so yourself: why he is now reckon'd
the third; except the breeches-maker from Barbican,
and Sawny Sinclair the snuffman, there
is not a mortal can touch him.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Peace, puppy; well Mr. Fairplay, leave the
papers a little longer with me and&mdash;pray who is
employ'd against you?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>A city attorney, one Sheepskin.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>A cunning fellow, I know him; well, Sir, if
you will call at Pump-court in a week.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">FAIRPLAY.</p></div>

<p>I shall attend you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Jack, open the door for Mr.&mdash;[<i>Exeunt</i> Fairplay
<i>and</i> Jack.] Something may be made of
this matter: I'll see this Sheepskin myself. So
much in future for carrying on the suit, or so
much in hand to make it miscarry: a wise man
should well weigh which party to take for.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><br />
<i>Enter</i> Jack.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So, Jack, any body at chambers to day?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Fieri Facias from Fetter lane, about the bill
to be filed by Kit Crape against Will Vizard,
this term.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Praying for an equal partition of plunder?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Yes, Sir.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Strange world we live in, that even highwaymen
can't be true to each other! [<i>half aside to
himself.</i>] but we shall make master Vizard refund,
we'll shew him what long hands the law
has.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Facias says, that in all the books he can't hit
on a precedent.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Then I'll make one myself; <i>aut inveniam, aut
faciam</i>, has been always my motto. The charge
must be made for partnership-profit, by bartering
lead and gunpowder, against money,
watches, and rings, on Epping-forest, Hounslow-heath,
and other parts of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>He says, if the court should get scent of the
scheme, the parties would all stand committed.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Cowardly rascal! but however, the caution
mayn't prove amiss. [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll not put my
own name to the bill.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>The declaration too is deliver'd in the cause
of Roger Rapp'em against Sir Solomon Simple.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What, the affair of the note?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Yes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why he is clear that his client never gave
such a note.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Defendant never saw plaintiff since the hour
he was born; but, notwithstanding, they have
three witnesses to prove a consideration, and
signing the note.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>They have?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>He is puzzled what plea to put in.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p><i>Three</i> witnesses ready, you say?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Yes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Tell him Simple must acknowledge the note,
[Jack <i>starts</i>] and bid him, against the trial
comes on, to procure <i>four</i> persons at least to
prove the payment, at the Crown and Anchor,
the 10th of December.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>But then how comes the note to remain in
plaintiff's possession?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well put, Jack; but we have a <i>salvo</i> for that;
plaintiff happen'd not to have the note in his
pocket, but promis'd to deliver it up, when
call'd thereunto by defendant.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>That will do rarely.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Let the defence be a secret, for I see we have
able people to deal with. But come, child, not
to lose time, have you carefully conn'd those
instructions I gave you?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Yes, Sir.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well, that we shall see. How many points
are the great object of practice?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Two.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Which are they?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>The first is to put a man into possession of
what is his right.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>The second?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Either to deprive a man of what is <i>really</i> his
right, or to keep him as long as possible <i>out</i> of
possession.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Good boy! To gain the last end, what are the
best means to be us'd?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Various and many are the legal modes of delay.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Name them.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Injunctions, demurrers, sham-pleas, writs of
error, rejoinders, sur-rejoinders, rebutters, sur-rebutters,
replications, exceptions, essoigns, and
imparlance.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>[<i>To himself.</i>] Fine instruments in the hands
of a man, who knows how to use them.&mdash;But
now, Jack, we come to the point: if an able advocate
has his choice in a cause, (which if he is
in reputation he may readily have,) which side
should he choose, the right, or the wrong?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>A great lawyer's business, is always to make
choice of the wrong.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>And prythee why so?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Because a good cause can speak for itself,
whilst a bad one demands an able counsellor to
give it a colour.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Very well. But in what respects will this answer
to the lawyer himself?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>In a two-fold way; firstly, his fees will be
large in proportion to the dirty work he is
to do.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Secondly?&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>His reputation will rise, by obtaining the victory
in a desperate cause.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Right, boy.&mdash;Are you ready in the case of
the cow?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Pretty well, I believe.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Give it then.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>First of April, anno seventeen hundred and
blank, John a Nokes was indicted by blank,
before blank, in the county of blank, for stealing
a cow, contra pacem etcet.&mdash;and against the
statute in that case provided and made, to prevent
stealing of cattle.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Go on.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Said Nokes was convicted upon the said statute.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>What follow'd upon?&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Motion in arrest of judgment, made by counsellor
Puzzle. First, Because the field from
whence the cow was convey'd is laid in the indictment
as <i>round</i>, but turn'd out upon proof
to be <i>square</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>That's well: a valid objection.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Secondly, Because in said indictment the colour
of the cow is called red, there being no
such things in rerum natura as red cows, no
more than black lions, spread eagles, flying
griffins, or blue boars.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well put.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Thirdly, said Nokes has not offended against
form of the statute; because stealing of <i>cattle</i>
is there provided against: whereas we are only
convicted of stealing a <i>cow</i>. Now, though cattle
may be cows, yet it does by no means follow
that cows must be cattle.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Bravo, bravo! buss me, you rogue, you are
your father's own son! go on, and prosper.&mdash;I
am sorry, dear Jack, I must leave thee. If
Providence but sends thee life and health, I prophesy,
thou wilt wrest as much land from the
owners, and save as many thieves from the gallows,
as any practitioner since the days of king
Alfred.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>I'll do my endeavour. [<i>Exit</i> Serjeant.]
So!&mdash;father is set off. Now if I can but lay
eyes on our Charlot, just to deliver this letter,
before madam comes home. There she is.&mdash;Hist,

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>A thing.</p>

<p>What thing?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>A thing that will please you I'm sure.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Come, don't be a boy, let me have it. [Jack

whom?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Can't you guess?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Not I; I don't know the hand.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>May be not; but you know the inditer.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Then tell me his name.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Break open the seal, and you'll find it.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>[<i>Opening the letter</i>] "Charles Woodford!"&mdash;I
am sure I know nothing of him.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Ay, but sister you do.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>How! when, and where?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Don't you remember about three weeks ago,
when you drank tea at our chambers, there
was a young gentleman in a blue sattin waist-coat,
who wore his own head of hair?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Well?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>That letter's from he.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>What can be his business with me?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Read that, and you'll know.</p>

<p>CHARLOT <i>reads</i>.</p>

<p>"Want words to apologize&mdash;hum, hum&mdash;very
first moment I saw you&mdash;hum, hum&mdash;smother'd
long in my breast&mdash;hum, hum&mdash;happiest,
or else the most wretched of men."&mdash;So,
Sir, you have undertaken a pretty commission!
and what do you think my father
will&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Why, I hope you won't go for to tell him.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, Sir, but I shall.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>No, sister, I'm sure you won't be so cross.
Besides, what could I do? The poor young
lad begg'd so hard; and there for this fortnight
he has gone about sighing, and musing,
and moping: I am satisfied it would melt you
to see him. Do, sister, let me bring him this
evening, now father is out.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Upon my word!&mdash;The young man has made
no bad choice of an agent; you are for pushing
matters at once.&mdash;But harkee, Sir, who is
this spark you are so anxious about? And how
long have you known him?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Oh! a prodigious long while: above a month
I am certain. Don't you think him mighty
genteel? I assure you he is vastly lik'd by the
ladies.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>He is.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Yes, indeed. Mrs. Congo, at the Grecian
coffee-house, says, he's the soberest youth that
comes to the house; and all Mrs. Mittens's
'prentices throw down their work, and run to
the window every time he goes by.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Upon my word!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>And moreover, besides that, he has several
great estates in the country; but only for the
present, he is kept out of 'em all by the owners.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Ah, Jack! that's the worst part of the story.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Pshaw! that's nothing at all. His guardian,
Mr. Fairplay, has been with father to-day, and
says, he is certain that he can set all to rights in
a trice.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>Well, Jack, when that point is determin'd,
it will be time enough to&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Then! Lord of mercy! why, sister Charlot,
it is my private opinion that if you don't give
him some crumbs of comfort, he won't live
till Midsummer term.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I warrant you. Either Cupid's darts were always
but poetical engines, or they have been
lately depriv'd of their points. Love holds no
place in the modern bills of mortality. However,
Jack, you may tell your friend, that I
have observ'd his frequent walks in our street.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Walks! Why one should think he was appointed
to relieve the old watchman; for no
sooner one is <i>off</i>, but the other comes <i>on</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>And that from his eyes being constantly fixed

I presume he is indebted to you.)<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>The ballot must be over by this time. Sure
there is nothing so dreadful as a state of suspence:
but should they black ball me!&mdash;No,
there's no danger of that; miss Mattadore has
insur'd me success.&mdash;Well, this is certainly one
of the most useful institutions; it positively
supplies the only point of time one does not
know how to employ. From twelve, the hour
of one's rising, to dinner, is a most horrible
chasm; for though teizing the mercers and milliners
by tumbling their wares, is now and then
an entertaining amusement, yet upon repetition
it palls.&mdash;But every morning to be sure of a
party, and then again at night after a rout, to
have a place to retire to; to be quite freed from
all pain of providing; not to be pester'd at table

Mattadore's hand. [<i>opens and reads the letter.</i>]
"My dear Circuit&mdash;it is with the utmost concern,

you, that notwithstanding all the pains
I have taken, the club have thought fit to reject."&mdash;Oh!

<p>Oh! Sir, is it you&mdash;my poor lady! [<i>cries</i>] clap

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>But how came it about?</p>

<p>Some of the <i>continents</i> of that curs'd letter,

<p>Nobody at all madam, but only Sir Luke.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Oh! Sir Luke, such a stroke, so fatal, so sudden,
it is not in nature I should ever survive it.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Marry heaven forbid! but what cause&mdash;what
could&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Leave the room. [<i>To the servants, who go
out.</i>] Only, look over that letter.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Hum, hum,&mdash;[<i>reads</i>] "fit to reject you&mdash;this&mdash;"</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>There! there! there!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>I own this is the utmost malice of fortune&mdash;but
let me finish the letter.&mdash;"This calamity,
dear Circuit, is of such a nature as baffles all
advice, or interposition of friends, I shall
therefore leave you to time, and your own
good understanding." [<i>pretty and sensible.</i>]&mdash;"yours,"
&amp;c.&mdash;But let us see, what says the
postscript&mdash;[<i>reads.</i>] "Perhaps it may give you
some comfort to know that you had sixteen
almonds, and but two raisins against you."</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>But two!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>No more.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>This must be Kitty Cribbage's doing, she has
been tattling about the paltry trifle I owe her.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Not unlikely: but come, bear up, my dear
madam, and consider that <i>two</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Is as bad as two thousand.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Granted; but perhaps it mayn't be too late
to repair.&mdash;Gadso! I have thought of a scheme&mdash;I'll
be elected myself, and then I warrant we
manage&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>You, Sir Luke? that never can be.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>No, Madam, and why not?&mdash;why you don't
suppose that they wou'd venture to&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>It would not only be against the spirit, but
the very letter of their constitution to chuse you
a member.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Ay, Madam, how so?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p><i>Their</i> statutes are selected from all the codes
that ever existed from the days of Lycurgus to
the present Czarina.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Well.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>The law that relates to your case they have
borrow'd from the Roman religion.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>As how?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>As no man can be admitted a monk, who has
the least corporal spot, or defect; so, no candidate
can be receiv'd as a member who is depriv'd
of the use of any one of his limbs.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Nay, then indeed I am clearly cut out; that
incapacity can never be got over.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, the Serjeant says, if the club could
be induc'd to <i>resolve</i> in your favour, then the
<i>original law</i> would signify nothing.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Well, well, we'll see what can be done. [<i>A
loud knocking.</i>] But hush! the company's come;
collect yourself, sweet Mrs. Circuit; don't give
your enemies the malicious pleasure of seeing
how this disappointment affects you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Simper hints at the little mistake made
this morning at the Thatch'd House.</p>

<p>Oh! I always detested the thoughts of the

I would, so I was reduc'd to the necessity of

</div>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Come, come, gentlemen, dispatch, the court
has been waiting some time. Brother Circuit,
you have look'd over your brief?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>What, do you suppose, Sir, that like some of
our brethren I defer that till I come into court?
No, no.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>This cause contains the whole marrow and
pith of all modern practice.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>One should think, Sir Luke, you had been
bred to the bar.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Child, I was some years in the Temple; but
the death of my brother robb'd the robe of my
labours.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. SIMPER.</p></div>

<p>What a loss to the public!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>You are smart, Mrs. Simper. I can tell you,
Serjeant Snuffle, whose manner I study'd, pronounc'd
me a promising youth.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. SIMPER.</p></div>

<p>I don't doubt it.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>But let us to business. And first, for the
state of the case: The parties you know are
Hobson and Nobson; the object of litigation is
a small parcel of land, which is to decide the
fate of a borough.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>True; call'd Turnbury Mead.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Very well. Then to bring matters to a short
issue, it was agreed, that Nobson should on the
premises cut down a tree, and Hobson bring
his action of damage.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>True, true.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>The jury being sworn, and the counsellors
feed, the court may proceed.&mdash;Take your seats&mdash;But
hold&mdash;I hope no gentleman has been
touch'd on both sides.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">ALL.</p></div>

<p>Oh! fye!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Let silence be call'd.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. SIMPER.</p></div>

<p>Silence in the court!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>But stop. To be regular, and provide for
fresh causes, we must take no notice of the borough
and lands, the real objects in view, but
stick fast to the tree, which is of no importance
at all.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">ALL.</p></div>

<p>True, true.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Brother Circuit, you may proceed.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Gentlemen of the Jury.&mdash;I am in this cause
counsel for Hobson, the plaintiff.&mdash;The action
is brought against Nebuchadonezer Nobson,
That he the said Nobson did cut down a tree,
value two-pence, and to his own use said tree
did convert.&mdash;Nobson justifies, and claims tree
as his tree. We will, gentlemen, first state the
probable evidence, and then come to the positive:
and first as to the probable.&mdash;When was
this tree here belonging to Hobson, and claim'd
by Nobson, cut down? Was it cut down publicly
in the day, in the face of the sun, men,
women, and children, all the world looking
on?&mdash;No; it was cut down privately, in the
night, in a dark night, nobody <i>did</i> see, nobody
<i>could</i> see.&mdash;Hum&mdash;And then with respect
and regard to this tree, I am instructed to say,
gentlemen, it was a beautiful, an ornamental
tree to the spot where it grew. Now can it be
thought that any man would come for to go in
the middle of the night, nobody seeing, nobody
<i>did</i> see, nobody <i>could</i> see, and cut down
a tree, which tree was an ornamental tree, if
tree had been his tree?&mdash;Certainly no.&mdash;And
again, gentlemen, we moreover insist, that this
tree was not only ornamental to the spot where
it grew, but it was a useful tree to the owner;
it was a plumb-tree, and not only a plum-tree,
but I am authored to say the best of
plum-trees, it was a damsin plum.&mdash;Now
can it be thought, that any man wou'd come for
to go, in the middle of the night, nobody seeing,
nobody <i>did</i> see, nobody <i>could</i> see, and cut
down a tree; which tree was not only an ornamental
tree, but a useful tree, and not only a
useful tree, but a plum-tree; and not only a
plum-tree, but the best of plum-trees, a damsin
plum? Most assuredly no.&mdash;If so be then,
that this be so, and so it most certainly is, I apprehend
no doubt will remain with the court,
but my client a verdict will have, with full costs
of suits, in such a manner and so forth, as may
nevertheless appear notwithstanding.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Have you done, Mr. Serjeant?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>You may proceed.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Gentlemen of the jury&mdash;I am in this cause
counsel for Hob&mdash;Zouns! I think the head
moves.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">ALL.</p></div>

<p>Hey!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">COLONEL.</p></div>

<p>No, no, Mrs. Simper, jogg'd the chair with
her foot, that was all.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>For Hercules Hobson&mdash;(I cou'd have sworn
it had stir'd)&mdash;I sha'nt gentlemen upon this occasion,
attempt to move your passions, by flowing
periods, and rhetorical flowers, as Mr.
Serjeant has done; no, gentlemen, if I get at your
hearts, I will make my way thro' your heads,
however thick they may be&mdash;in order to which,
I will pursue the learned gentleman, thro' what
he calls his probable proofs: and first, as to
this tree's being cut down in the night; in part
we will grant him that point, but, under favour,
not a dark night, Mr. Serjeant; no, quite the
reverse, we can prove that the moon shone
bright, with uncommon lustre that night&mdash;So
that if so be as how people did not see that was
none&mdash;[Serjeant <i>sneezes</i>.] nay, Mrs. Circuit, if
you break the thread of my&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Me break!&mdash;I said nothing I'm sure.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>That's true, but you sneez'd.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Not I.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>I am sure somebody did; it could not be the
head&mdash;consider the least interruption puts one
out of one's&mdash;None of our faults, they might
have look'd on and seen if they would. And
then as to this beautiful tree, with which Mr.
Serjeant has ornamented his spot&mdash;No, gentlemen,
no such matter at all; I am instructed to
say quite the reverse; a stunted tree, a blighted,
blasted tree; a tree not only limbless, and leafless,
but very near lifeless; that was the true
state of the tree: and then as to its use, we
own it was a plum-tree indeed, but not of the
kind Mr. Serjeant sets forth, a damsin plum;
our proofs say loudly a bull plum; but if so
be and it had been a damsin plum, will any
man go for to say, that a damsin plum is the
best kind of plum; not a whit, I take upon
me to say it is not a noun substantive plum&mdash;with
plenty of sugar it does pretty well indeed
in a tart, but to eat it by itself, will Mr. Serjeant
go to compare it with the queen mother, the
padrigons&mdash;</p>

<p>Nay, for the matter of that, I ha'n't been idle;
[<i>both drink</i>.] But come, throw off your gown,
and let us finish the bottle: I ha'n't had such a
mind to be merry I can't tell the day when.</p>

<p>Nay then, Mr. Serjeant, have at you&mdash;come,
here's long life and health to the law. [<i>Drinks.</i>]</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I'll pledge that toast in a bumper.&mdash;[<i>Drinks.</i>]&mdash;I'll

the truth out of the Knight by a bottle. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>I'll try if I can't fuddle the fool, and get rid of
him that way. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I could not have thought it: why where the

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Did not you know her? Mrs. Simper, your

<p>A pestilent jade! she's a good one I warrant.</p>

<p>Why to be sure the knight is overtaken a little;
very near drunk.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>I hope he believes it is a lie. [<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Do me instant justice on this defamer, this
lyar, or never more expect to see me in your
house.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I begin to find out the fraud, this is all a
flam of the knight's.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>I'll drive this instant to a friend of mine in the
Commons, and see if no satisfaction can be had,
for blasting the reputation of a woman like me&mdash;and
hark you Sir, what inducement, what
devil could prompt?&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Ay; what devil could prompt&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Heyday!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>But I guess at your motive; you flatter'd
yourself, that by marrying Charlot, and discarding
of me you should engross all his affections
and&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>True, true&mdash;stop, my life, let me come at
him, a little: hark you, Mr. Knight, I begin to
discover that you are a very sad dog.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Et tu Brute!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Brute!&mdash;you'll find I am not the brute you
would have made me believe&mdash;I have consider'd
both sides of the question.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Both sides of the question?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Both: if your story is true, you are a scoundrel
to debauch the wife of your friend; and if
it is false, you are an infamous lyar.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Well argued.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>So in both cases, get out of my house.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Nay, but Serjeant&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Troop I tell you, and never again enter these
walls&mdash;you have libelled my wife, and I will
see you no more.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Was there ever such a&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>March! and as to my daughter, I would as
soon marry her to a forma pauperis client.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit Sir Luke.</i></p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Do you consider, Mr. Circuit, where you are
pushing the fellow?&mdash;That chamber is Charlot's.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smallcaps">Luke, Woodford, Charlot</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Jack</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Heyday! who the deuce have we here?&mdash;Pray
walk in, my good folks&mdash;your servant Miss
Charlot; your servant Mr. What-d'ye-call-um.&mdash;Mr.
Serjeant, you need not trouble yourself
to cater for Miss; your family you see can provide
for themselves.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Heyday! What the deuce is all this! Who
are you Sir, and how came you here? [<i>To</i> Woodford.]</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>It was I, father, that brought him.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How, sirrah!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Well said my young limb of the law.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Come, let us have none o'your&mdash;tho' I
brought Mr. Woodford, you could not persuade
me to do the same office for you&mdash;father, never
stir if he did not make me the proffer, if I would
let him into the house the night you was at
Kingston, of a new pair of silk stockings, and
to learn me a minuet.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Me! I should never have got you to turn
out your toes.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>Ay, and moreover you made me push out
my chest, and do so with my fingers, as if I
was taking two pinches of snuff.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>You see, Mr. Serjeant, what a fondness, I
have for every twig of your family.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>I shall thank <i>you</i> hereafter&mdash;but from you,
Charlot, I expected other guess&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>When, Sir, you hear this whole matter explain'd,
you will acquit I am sure.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">WOODFORD.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, Sir, <i>I</i> am wholly to blame; my being
here was as much a surprize upon Miss
Charlot as&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>But now you are here, pray what's your business?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>O! father, I can acquaint you with that&mdash;he
wanted me to bring a love letter to Charlot,
so I told him he might bring it himself, for that
I would not do any such thing for never so much,
for fear of offending of you.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>You mended the matter indeed&mdash;but after all,
who, and what are you?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>It's the young gentleman that lives over our
heads, to whom Mr. Fairplay is guardian.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Who, Woodford?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">JACK.</p></div>

<p>The same.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>And are you, young man in a situation to think
of a wife?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">WOODFORD.</p></div>

<p>I am flattered, Sir, that as <i>justice</i> is with me,
I shall one day have no contemptible fortune to
throw at her feet.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p><i>Justice</i> is! What signifies justice?&mdash;Is the
<i>law</i> with you, you fool?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">WOODFORD.</p></div>

<p>With your help, Sir, I should hope for their
<i>union</i>, upon this occasion at least.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Well, Sir, I shall re-consider your papers,
and, if there are probable grounds, I may be
induc'd to hear your proposals.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">WOODFORD.</p></div>

<p>Nay then, Sir, the recovering my paternal
possessions makes me anxious indeed.&mdash;Could I
hope that the young lady's good wish would attend
me?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">CHARLOT.</p></div>

<p>I have a father, and can have no will of my
own.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>So then it seems poor Pil Garlick here is
discarded at once.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Why, could you have the impudence, after
what has happen'd, to hope that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>He has given wonderful proofs of his modesty.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Be quiet, Mrs. Circuit.&mdash;Come, good folks,
I will set all matters to rights in a minute; and
first, Mr. Serjeant, it becomes me to tell you,
that I never intended to marry your daughter.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How! never!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Never. She is a fine girl I allow; but would
it now, Mr. Serjeant, have been honest in me,
to have robb'd the whole sex of my person, and
confin'd my favors to her?</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>No! I was struck with the immorality of the
thing; and therefore to make it impossible that
you should ever give me your daughter, I invented
the story I told you concerning Mrs.
Circuit and me.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>How!</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>Truth, upon my honour.&mdash;Your wife there
will tell you the whole was a lye.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">SERJEANT.</p></div>

<p>Nay, then indeed.&mdash;But with what face can
I look up to my dear? I have injur'd her beyond
the hopes of forgiveness.&mdash;Wou'd you,
lovee, but pass an act of oblivion&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Sir LUKE.</p></div>

<p>See me here prostrate to implore your clemency
in behalf of my friend.</p>

<div class="center"><p class="noindent">Mrs. CIRCUIT.</p></div>

<p>Of that I can't determine directly.&mdash;But as
you seem to have some sense of your guilt, I
shall grant you a reprieve for the present,
which contrition and amendment may, perhaps,
in time swell into a pardon.</p>
